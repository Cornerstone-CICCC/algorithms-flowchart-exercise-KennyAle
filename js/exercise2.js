// Write an algorithm and draw a flowchart that will read the two sides of a rectangle and calculate its area.

// Pseudocode:

// - Input the width (W) and the length (L) of a rectangle
// - Calculate the area (A) by multiplying W by L
// - Print A

let W = 10
let L = 5
let A = W * L
console.log(A)
